# Log Analytics Query Definitions

Queries, saved as `.kql` files, in this directory are automatically imported into Log Analytics during the Terraform apply process.

The `stamp` directory contains per-stamp queries, the `global` directory contains only queries applied to the global services Log Analytics workspace.

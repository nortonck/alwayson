# User Load Generator

This sub-project contains a solution to generate load on a web application based on the Playwright UI testing framework and Azure Functions.

See [Getting Started](#getting-started) on how to set this up for your own application.

It contains of the following components:

- [Global Orchestrator Azure Function](./AzureFunctions/GlobalOrchestrator) that controls regionally distributed test runner Azure Functions
- [User flow test runner Azure Function](./AzureFunctions/RegionalLoadGenerator) which are getting deployed to N number of regions
- Terraform [infrastructure-as-code definition](./infra) to deploy the Azure Functions
- Azure DevOps [pipeline definition](/.ado/pipelines/azure-deploy-loadgenerator.yaml) to deploy the infrastructure and the Functions

This graph shows a sample load pattern that has been generated by the User Load Generator over 48 hours:

## Playwright test definition

The user load generator uses the Playwright UI testing framework to generate load on the web application. The load generator does not contain a test definition file itself. Instead, the test definition is defined in a separate file [/src/testing/ui-test-playwright/cataloguserflow.spec.js](/src/testing/ui-test-playwright/cataloguserflow.spec.js) and being injected into the Function as part of the deployment process.

## Global Orchestrator Azure Function

This is a Timer-triggered Azure Function that orchestrates the regional test runner Azure Functions.
For this it reads a load profile definition file `daily_load_profile.json` which lets the user define various load patterns per day, split by different geographical regions.

### Load profile definition file

The load profile definition file is a JSON file that contains the following structure:

```
{
  "geos": [
    {
      "name": "EMEA",
      "timezone": "UTC+01:00",
      "enabled":  true,
      "timeframes": [
        {
          "start": "00:00:00",
          "end": "03:00:00",
          "numberOfUsers": 1000,
          "transitionTimeMinutes": 40
        },
        //...
    }
 ]
}
```

- `geos`: An array of geographical regions.
    - `name`: The name of the geographical region. Can be freely chosen but must match what is being used in the Terraform variable definition `regional_functions_workers` (in `src/testing/userload-generator/infra/variables.tf`).
    - `timezone`: The time zone of the geographical region, based on offset from UTC.
    - `enabled`: A flag to indicate if the geographical region is enabled and should be considered by the orchestrator.
    - `timeframes`: An array of timeframes.
        - `start`: The start time of the timeframe.
        - `end`: The end time of the timeframe.
        - `numberOfUsers`: The number of users that should be generated in this timeframe.
        - `transitionTimeMinutes`: The number of minutes to ramp up or down to the number of users from the previous timeframe.

Notes:
- Timeframes must not overlap
- Timeframes can be directly adjacent to each other but do not have to. There can be gaps. Gaps are being interpreted as "run 0 users".


## User flow test runner Azure Function

This function gets deployed to a number of regionally distributed Azure Functions (as defined in the `regional_functions_workers` variable in the Terraform definition). It executes the Playwright test definition file using an actual (headless) Chromium browser.

It is implemented as a Durable Function which gets controlled by the Global Orchestrator via an HttpTrigger. The durable Orchestrator will then kick off N number of local Activity Functions and restart them as soon as one batch is finished. It will do so until it gets a new command (a different number of users to run) by the Global Orchestrator (this is called an "Eternal Orchestrator").

## Getting Started

To deploy the user load generator for your own application, you need to:

- Write a playwright test definition file (`cataloguserflow.spec.js`) that targets your web UI application.
  - Use the example provided here as a starting point. Note how environment variables are being used to pass parameters like the application URL and the user credentials. You can replicate this for other settings you might need.
- Update the `daily_load_profile.json` file with your desired load profile. To validate your profile, is recommended to start with only one geographical region enabled and then gradually add more regions as needed.
- Update the Terraform variable file `variables.tf` with the correct values for `targeturl`, `regional_functions_workers` and any other variables you might need to reflect test parameters and your geo(s).

To deploy the infrastructure and the Functions, you can use the Azure DevOps pipeline definition (`/.ado/pipelines/azure-deploy-loadgenerator.yaml`). [Import](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/clone-import-pipeline) that pipeline definition into your Azure DevOps project and run the pipeline.
